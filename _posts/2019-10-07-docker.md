#### Install pandas 
```
FROM python:3.6-slim
```
The issue is pip uses manylinux1 wheels which doesn't support Alpine's musl.
Which means that you'll be installing the packages from source.

I would advise using `python:slim` which supports the `manylinux1` wheels
and also saves considerable time and space comparatively.
