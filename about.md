    <p>I am following the principles on which Steve Job built himself: WHAT? HOW? WHY?</p>
    <h3>WHAT steps did I take towards AI?</h3>
    <p>The 21st century brought with it three basic rules: educate yourself to <span style="color: #007BFF;">MAKE</span>, practice and work hard to <span style="color: #28A745;">CREATE</span> and think differently to <span style="color: #DC3545;">INNOVATE</span>. AI is a leading source of change and I do not want to stand apart from it: my will is to participate.</p>
    <p>I learned on how to <span style="color: #007BFF;">MAKE</span> by completing a Master’s degree in Data Science at the Technical University of Munich, which followed my Bachelor’s in System Analysis. In parallel, I gained practical experience in Product building (Pyne), ML (Genesis, Mergespot), in SWE (Microsoft, Tacto) and in research (Telecom Paris) over the last 6 years.</p>
    <p>All in all, the result of this <span style="color: #007BFF;">MAKEING</span> nurtured my passions for NLP, Speech Recognition and Knowledge Graphs. In this regard, I performed a research at Telecom Paris within the DIG group under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Bonald. Our cooperation resulted in a research paper - "Pairwise Adjusted Mutual Information". I extended our work with my Master’s Thesis, which was awarded with Honours.</p>
    <h3>HOW did I contribute to data driven solutions?</h3>
    <p>As far as the <span style="color: #28A745;">CREATE</span> part of the equation is concerned, my latest and biggest impact on users comes from my work at Pyne. I have joined the team as a first employee (Founding Engineer). I contributed to the team with knowledge on how to build MVPs quickly, iterate ideas fast and keep the product at the centre of everything. At Pyne we embarked on the ambitious mission of building a comprehensive revenue operating system for B2B SaaS companies. This complex project demanded expertise in data engineering, coupled with a thorough understanding of sales, marketing, and customer success workflows. I was responsible for complex data integrations, modelling, and management systems, encompassing tools like Outreach, HubSpot, Salesforce, and Stripe. Furthermore, I played a pivotal role in backend development, product management, and team recruitment. Notably, I pioneered <span style="color: #DC3545;">INNOVATIVE</span> solutions leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of monthly business reviews based on customer data, significantly enhancing operational efficiency.</p>
    <p>It is also worth mentioning my work at Microsoft and contributions to the Azure Speech Service product. Due to my curiosity, I have worked in multiple teams. At the Research team I was responsible for training an Acoustic Diarist Identification system for the Swiss language. I learned how to use the Kalidi framework, as well as how to run distributed training on multiple GPUs. As part of the Engineering team, I developed a pipeline for automatic deployment, testing and updating of Speech Recognition models available in more than 70 locales worldwide and serving 100k people daily. This pipeline reduced the deployment time of new models into production by a factor of 10. I integrated the project into a vast codebase requiring communication with more than 10 Product Owners.</p>
