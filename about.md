    <p>I'm a data-driven problem solver with years of experience in AI, Data Engineering and Machine Learning. 
    I have strong technical skills in Mathematics, Data Science, and Software Engineering. 
    I'm driven by the desire to work in growth environment and committed to make a meaningful impact on the world through AI. 
    I'm a team player with a strong "get-it-done" attitude and a passion for continuous learning.
    
    <p>I received my Bachelor degree in System Analysis at the National Technical University of Ukraine. I have a deep knowledge of math, physics, algorithms and programming languages. I have supplemented my knowledge by attending various seminars held in different colleges. I presented papers on “Usage of artificial neural networks in the energy sector” at Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems Conference, International Level Technical Conference.</p>

    <p>During the last 4 years I made intensive progress in the field of Machine Learning and Big Data:
	<ul>
		<li> gained industry experience working at Jiji.ng </li> 
		<li> developed projects from scratch and worked with legacy code </li>
		<li> worked with AWS products: EC2, TensorFlow on AWS and RDS    </li>
		<li> participated in many Data Science competitions and hackathons </li>
		<li> I have experience working in a team and developing projects from scratch </li>
		<li> I have participated in many competitions and hackathons for Data Scientists </li>
		<li> I have a potential as a future leader who is not afraid to dream big and think globally. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

    <p>Along with my studies, I participated in numerous extracurricular activities. Since 2015 I have been an active member of SCI. It is a voluntary organisation dedicated to promote a culture of peace, social justice and sustainable development. I introduce East European values to my peers by sharing Ukrainian history and traditions which is helpful to build up a fair perception of our potential as a country to the rest of the world.</p>
