    <p>I am following the principles on which Steve Job built himself: WHAT? HOW? WHY?</p>
    <h3>WHAT steps did I take towards AI?</h3>
    <p>The 21st century brought with it three basic rules: educate yourself to <span style="color: #007BFF;">MAKE</span>, practice and work hard to <span style="color: #28A745;">CREATE</span> and think differently to <span style="color: #DC3545;">INNOVATE</span>. AI is a leading source of change and I do not want to stand apart from it: my will is to participate.</p>
    <p>I learned on how to <span style="color: #007BFF;">MAKE</span> by completing a Master’s degree in Data Science at the Technical University of Munich, which followed my Bachelor’s in System Analysis. In parallel, I gained practical experience in Product building (Pyne), ML (Genesis, Mergespot), in SWE (Microsoft, Tacto) and in research (Telecom Paris) over the last 6 years.</p>
    <p>All in all, the result of this <span style="color: #007BFF;">MAKEING</span> nurtured my passions for NLP, Speech Recognition and Knowledge Graphs. In this regard, I performed a research at Telecom Paris within the DIG group under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Bonald. Our cooperation resulted in a research paper - "Pairwise Adjusted Mutual Information". I extended our work with my Master’s Thesis, which was awarded with Honours.</p>
    <h3>HOW did I contribute to data driven solutions?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Founding Engineer at Pyne, contributing to MVP development, idea iteration, and product-centric approach.</li>
        <li>Developed a comprehensive revenue operating system for B2B SaaS companies, involving complex data integrations and management systems.</li>
        <li>Implemented <span style="color: #DC3545;">INNOVATIVE</span> solutions using large language models (LLMs) to automate monthly business reviews.</li>
        <li>Contributions at Microsoft to the Azure Speech Service product, including training an Acoustic Diarist Identification system and developing a pipeline for model deployment.</li>
    </ul>
