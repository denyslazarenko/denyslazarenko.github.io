    <p>Mark Zuckerberg once said: “Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough”. Currently, this quotation is the driving force of my life. Living in the 21 century, we should follow three basic rules: MAKE. CREATE. INNOVATE. Data Science is the leading force of innovation. It is our future and I do not want to stand apart. My choice is to PARTICIPATE.</p>

    <p>I received my Bachelor degree in System Analysis at the National Technical University of Ukraine. I have a deep knowledge of math, physics, algorithms and programming languages. I have supplemented my knowledge by attending various seminars held in different colleges. I presented papers on “Usage of artificial neural networks in the energy sector” at Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems Conference, International Level Technical Conference.</p>

    <p>During the last 4 years I made intensive progress in the field of Machine Learning and Big Data:
	<ul>
		<li> gained industry experience working at Jiji.ng </li> 
		<li> developed projects from scratch and worked with legacy code </li>
		<li> worked with AWS products: EC2, TensorFlow on AWS and RDS    </li>
		<li> participated in many Data Science competitions and hackathons </li>
		<li> I have experience working in a team and developing projects from scratch </li>
		<li> I have participated in many competitions and hackathons for Data Scientists </li>
		<li> I have a potential as a future leader who is not afraid to dream big and think globally. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

    <p>Along with my studies, I participated in numerous extracurricular activities. Since 2015 I have been an active member of SCI. It is a voluntary organisation dedicated to promote a culture of peace, social justice and sustainable development. I introduce East European values to my peers by sharing Ukrainian history and traditions which is helpful to build up a fair perception of our potential as a country to the rest of the world.</p>
